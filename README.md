# Routerman

Minimal routing framework with hyper integration

## State of development

The crate is in a very early state. Specifically, documentation and tests are severly lacking to
non-existent right now (contributions very welcome).

That being said, the general API should stay along the lines of the current implementation, though
there will be no reservation towards making breaking changes.

### To Do:
- Documentation
- Tests
- HEAD, OPTIONS handling
